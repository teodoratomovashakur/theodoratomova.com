						I am a PhD Candidate in Management and Organizations at Stern School of Business, New York University.  
					</p>
					<p class="bio-text">
						I am fascinated by network tie favoritism (e.g., nepotism, cronyism, and referral-based hiring) at work. My research investigates the core motivations, driving individuals to favor their network ties, and the intended and unintended consequences of such favoritism for individuals, organizations, and society at large. In my research program, I employ a mixed-methods approach, including field and laboratory experiments and surveys, archival methods, and meta-analytic methodology. My research has been published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin and has been recognized by the Academy of Management (Best Paper Award in 2021) and funded by the Center for Global Economy and Business.

					</p>
					<p class="bio-text">
						I received a M.Phil in Management from New York University and a B.A. in Psychology (Honors) from the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to joining Stern, I gained experience in consulting and Human Resources; experiences that gave rise to my career as a researcher.
