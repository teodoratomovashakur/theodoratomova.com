						My teaching goal – make it match my teaching statement.
					</p>
					<p class="pub-text">
						I have taught a core undergraduate course at New York University, Stern School of Business, covering a wide range of organizational behavior and strategy topics, such as structure, leadership, negotiations, teamwork, social networking, among others (class: Management and Organizations; class size: 25 students; ratings: 4.8/5.0; Evaluation Response Rate: 67%).
					</p>
					<p class="pub-text">
						I have also served as a Teaching Fellow for a variety of classes at NYU Stern such as Negotiation and Consensus Building course (undergraduate-level, master-level, and MBA), Leadership in Organizations course (master-level), and Management and Organizations (undergraduate-level). 
					</p>
					<p class="pub-text">
						As the lead instructor for the Management and Organizations course in January 2020, I was encouraged by the positive evaluations I received from my undergraduate students. Many of my students shared that they were inspired by passion for research and teaching, and described me as a friendly, helpful and knowledgeable instructor. In addition to the favorable comments my students left (sample comments below), 12% of my class later became involved with me on various research projects.

					</p>
					<ul id="teaching_list">
						<li>“Thank you so much for an amazing past few weeks. I've learned more in this class than I probably did all last semester. You know how to teach the material, but also how to teach us to apply it. You're really passionate with helping us learn and teaching the topic, and it really shows. I wish you the best on your research and continued teaching career!”</li>
						<li>“Professor Tomova is a great professor easily one of my favorites at NYU. However, I did poorly on her exam so she is a tough grader.”</li>
						<li>“The instructor was friendly.“</li>
						<li>“She was fantastic! Really enjoyed her presence and instruction.” 	</li>
