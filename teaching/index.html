						I instructed a core undergraduate course at New York University, Stern School of Business, covering a wide range of topics, such as organizational strategy and structure, leadership, negotiations, diversity, teamwork, and social networking, among others (course: Management and Organizations; class size: 25 students; ratings: 4.8/5.0; Evaluation Response Rate: 67%).
					</p>
					<p class="pub-text">
						My pedagogic style was highly recognized by my students (sample feedback below). Additionally, many of my students became involved in various research projects of mine after the completion of the course, thus highlighting the impact of my passion for research, mentorship and teaching.

					<ul id="teaching_list">
						<li>“Professor Tomova is a great professor easily one of my favorites at NYU.”</li>
						<li>“She was fantastic! Really enjoyed her presence and instruction.”</li>
						<li>“Thank you so much for an amazing past few weeks. I've learned more in this class than I probably did all last semester. You know how to teach the material, but also how to teach us to apply it. You're really passionate with helping us learn and teaching the topic, and it really shows. I wish you the best on your research and continued teaching career!”</li>
						<li>“The instructor was friendly.“</li>
					</ul>
