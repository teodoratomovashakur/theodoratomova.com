						I teach Organizational Management at the undergraduate level (MANA 30153; TCU). This class is usually capped at 37 students (Fall 2022: 4.7/5; Fall 2023: 4.1/5, Fall 2024: 4.7/5). I have also taught Organizational Management at the undergraduate level at New York University (Winter 2020: 4.8/5). I really enjoy teaching and am excited to teach Essentials of Motivation at the graduate level next Fall!
